HOWTO USE

git submodule init 
git submodule update 
vagrant up 



NOTE:

I've splitted out the gdash box where we have the rubygem hell for now

We're in rubygem hell, this box currently works for 90% ,
It barfs on rubygems (sinatra) that it installs from EPEL where it should install them from the rubygems repo 
at inuits.    Removing the gem + some deps  (yum remove rubygem-rack) , then disabling EPEL and reinstalling rubygem-sinatra
again currently solves this but I need to find a better approach for this.


Need to find a way to package gem bundles as RPM.  Rather than individual gems hence creating gem dep hell.


Tested on CentOS now

Packages can be build using SPECS from

Which I have build and placed on

We all love ngrep :
ngrep -d eth1 . dst port 2003
