INSTRUCTIONS:
Download all files
Change Vagrantfile to your fedora15 basebox (I will upload mine later on)
Vagrant up
Graphite is running locally on port 8080 and on port 50051 when you connect from outside (portfw)
An example client will start polling and feeding carbon with the load average of the system at boot

Note: Vagrantfile tested with a fedora15 box build from a veewee/vagrant template
