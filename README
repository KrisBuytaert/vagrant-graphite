WIP 

Initial work to get it going on Centos.
Refactored  to use modules

And use packages rather than untarring the files.

Packages can be build using SPECS from 
https://github.com/dcarley/graphite-rpms/

Which I have build and placed on repo.inuits.eu 



Current state is possibly broken  as I`m in the mid of changing from the tars that live in /opt to the rpms that live in 
correct FHS locations
