Added a cron job that outputs http logs changes (based on logster) to graphite



Works on CentOS now 
Refactored  to use modules
And use packages rather than untarring the files.

Packages can be build using SPECS from 
https://github.com/dcarley/graphite-rpms/

Which I have build and placed on

We all love ngrep :
ngrep -d eth1 . dst port 2003
